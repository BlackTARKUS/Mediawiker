## Mediawiker 3.1.9

### Mwclient library update
* Mwclient internal library was partly synced with latest original [version](http://mwclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Syntax highlighting
* New highlighting scheme in new **sublime-syntax** engine (for ST3) as a default scheme.
    - Improvements in highlighting
    - Tests for validation (`syntax_test_mediawikerng.mediawiki`)
    - Old tmLanguage versions for ST2 compatibility only - needs to set correct value in configuration (`Mediawiki_ST2.tmLanguage` or `MediawikiNG_ST2.tmLanguage`).

### Comments (pre-beta, unfinished)
* Possibility to create/edit internal notes for selected text blocks - notes will be stored in Sublime text only.
    - Some magic words are supported in notes: `TODO`, `NOTE`, `WARNING`.

### OAuth authorization
* [OAuth authorization](http://mwclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/connecting.html#oauth) support.

### HTTPS as default proto
* For sites without https support, option `"https": false` is required.
